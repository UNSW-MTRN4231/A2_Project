[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findyolo_ros.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "yolo_ros",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "yolo_ros" with any
  of the following names:

    yolo_rosConfig.cmake
    yolo_ros-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "yolo_ros" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "yolo_ros_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "yolo_ros" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
